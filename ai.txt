I attempted to make my computer player smarter than choosing a random legal move very turn.
I was able to make my AI smarter.

My computer player is smarter than choosing a random move,
but more advanced AI could be used (ex. using strategy, predicting future move, etc.)

I had my AI always choose the legal move that flips the most tiles.
If there is a tie for most, it would choose one of those moves.
My algorithm was pretty simple to implement, given the way I found all legal moves.
I found all the legal moves by starting at the square and moving in all 8 directions, using a loop.
The program would check if there was an opposing tile, and keep going one there was.
If it eventually hit a turn player tile, that was a legal move.
To implement my algorithm, I used similar code, but create a tiles flipped counter,
and kept track of tiles flipped in a list.
I then chose the maximum number from that list, and had my AI choose that move.

The AI beat a human player about 50% of the time. 

To improve in the future, I would use a more complicated AI.
The AI could be taught to follow a certain strategy,
or to predict opponents moves, and choose a better option.
